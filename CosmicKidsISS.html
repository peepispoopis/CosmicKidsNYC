<p><p>
Earth is often described as a floating blue marble by those brave few who have had the chance to see our planet from the vastness of space. From that perspective, we are all one community of people, plants, animals, oceans, air, and more. That is the leading principle behind the International Space Station! Rather than being owned by one country, the ISS is a kind of home away from home for many astronauts and space explorers of many different nationalities. For the US’s part, NASA represents our country’s team of scientists, space rangers, and interests both aboard the ISS and here on the ground.

The ISS has been in orbit around our planet for 25 years, but began being constructed by the US, Japan, Canada, and Europe in the early 1980’s. The ISS program brings together flight crews, launches and landings, refueling, communication networks, training programs, and a place for scientists to perform research.
